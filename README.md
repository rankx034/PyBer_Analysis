# Examining Total Fares by City Type
## Overview
In this project, the focus of analysis was total fares earned in urban, suburban, and rural city types by drivers employed by the company PyBer. The time range of the data shown spans 10 weeks from the beginning of January to the beginning of March 2019. This information is intended to be used by key decision-makers and stakeholders at PyBer to determine driver allocations in such a way that will maximize both revenue and coverage. 

## Results

The first step in the analysis was finding totals and averages for the rides, drivers, and fares. These were then grouped by city type and put into a DataFrame. It is at this point that we can see the distribution of revenue as it relates to city types. This breakdown is visualized below in Figure 1.

The key takeaways are that urban localities saw 13x more rides and generated 9x more revenue than rural localities. When we look specifically at the fares, we can see that this trend continued over the entirety of the time range covered by this analysis. Figure 2 below shows all three city types as line graphs, with the x-axis representing each week of the analysis.

## Summary
Overall, PyBer's focus should be on increasing coverage in suburban and urban areas, as the demand is greater there and is most likely to generate more revenue. That being said, it would behoove PyBer to continue this analysis for the course of one entire calendar year instead of a 10-week period. This analysis would help to visualize whether there are cyclical trends in demand, specificallly in rural areas. In such an analysis, I would recommend paying particular attention to demand in suburban and rural areas on holiday weekends or other times of the year where there is a noted upsurge in DUI occurrence. Focus during these times would be mostly on rural and suburban cities as these are areas that are less likely to have public transportation coverage, and therefore people are more likely to make the decision to drive after drinking on a holiday.
